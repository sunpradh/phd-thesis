\label{chap:dualities_in_abelian_models}

In this chapter we present the findings of \cite{pradhan2022ladder}, where a duality transformation from the gauge-invariant subspace of a $\Z_N$ \ac{lgt} on a ladder geometry to an $N$-clock model on a single chain.
The main feature of this mapping is the emergence of a longitudinal field in the clock model, whose value depends on the super-selection sector of the gauge model.
% , implying that the different sectors of the gauge theory can show quite different phase diagrams.
In order to investigate this and see if confined phases might emerge, we perform a numerical analysis for $N = 2, 3,$ and $4$, using \acl{ed}.

\section{Concluding remarks}
\label{sec:concluding_remarks}

In this work, we proposed an exact gauge preserving duality transformation that maps the  $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory on a ladder onto a 1D $N-$clock model in a transversal field, coupled to a possibly complex longitudinal field which depends on the super-selection sector.

This map allowed us to perform numerical simulations with an \ac{ed} algorithm with sizes up to $L=18, 13, 10$ for $N=2,3,4$ respectively.
To study the phases of the model and a possible \ac{dcpt} transition, we calculated the Wilson loops in the different topological sectors, finding an unusual behaviour in the sectors with $n$ odd (mod $N$), possibly suggesting the emergence of a new phase, such as for example the incommensurate phase appearing in chiral clock models \cite{huse1983chiral, whitsitt2018clock, zhuang2015clock}, whose characterization requires however to consider longer sizes of the chain in order to evaluate the asymptotic behaviour of correlators.

This will be the subject of future work, in which we can also consider the possibility to include static and dynamical matter in the lattice gauge model.
Another possible direction would be the extension of these duality transformations to non-Abelian gauge theories.

% This, in my opinion, is not so trivial.
% The models explored in the work are, in a sense, comparable to the Abelian case of \emph{Quantum Double Models} (QDMs) \cite{kitaev2003fault}.
% In this class of models, particle excitations follow very clear algebraic rules, which in the case of non-Abelian groups yield a complicated spectrum of particles.
% If a relation between the physical states of a non-Abelian gauge model and the particle excitations in a similar QDMs can be established, then the full technology of the algebraic structures underlying QDMs can be exploited.
% In particular, one could define similar super-selection sectors using the equivalents of ribbon operators in QDMs.
% From there, I think, it is possible to construct duality maps that resemble those in \cite{pradhan2022ladder}.
