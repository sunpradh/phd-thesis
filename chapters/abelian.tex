\chapter{Dualities in Abelian Models}
\label{chap:dualities_in_abelian_models}

In this chapter we present the findings of \cite{pradhan2022ladder}, where a duality transformation from the gauge-invariant subspace of a $\Z_N$ \ac{lgt} on a ladder geometry to an $N$-clock model on a single chain.
The main feature of this mapping is the emergence of a longitudinal field in the clock model, whose value depends on the super-selection sector of the gauge model.
% , implying that the different sectors of the gauge theory can show quite different phase diagrams.
In order to investigate this and see if confined phases might emerge, we perform a numerical analysis for $N = 2, 3,$ and $4$, using \acl{ed}.
