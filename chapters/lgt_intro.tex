One of the most important open questions regarding high-energy physics is confinement in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), or in general in a non-Abelian gauge theory.
The best evidence for confinement comes from the Wilson formulation of gauge theories on a lattice \cite{wilson1974confinement}, which, at first glance, can appear odd because the vacuum is not a crystal.
Indeed, there have not been experimental proofs so far that show any deviations for the symmetries of the Lorentz group.

From the point of view of particle physics, the lattice represents a mathematical trick.
It provides a cutoff, which removes the ultraviolet infinities that infest quantum field theory (QFT).
It is just a regulator and as such it must be removed after renormalization.
Physical results can only be extracted in the continuum limit, where the lattice spacing goes to zero.

But why do we need such a regulator?
Infinities has always been present in quantum field theories since its conception.
Consider the case of Quantum Electrodynamics.
It had an immense success without ever using a discrete space-time, thanks to \emph{perturbation theory}.
The most conventional calculation schemes are based on Feynman expansions,
where a given observable is expressed as a power series in the interaction coupling.
The terms are computed until a divergence is met in a particular diagram.
These divergences can then be removed with some regularization method.

The reason why this methodology does not work in non-Abelian theories lies in the fact that some phenomena, like confinement, are inherently \emph{non-perturbative}.
Roughly speaking, perturbation theory relies on the fact that the true interacting theory is just a slight modification of the free theory.
In other words, it works only when the coupling constants are small.
In the case of QCD, the free theory with vanishing coupling constant has no resemblance to the observed phenomenon.

In order to go beyond the diagrammatic approach of Feynman expansions, one needs a non-perturbative cutoff.
This is the main strength of the lattice, it eliminates all the wavelengths smaller than the lattice spacing before any kind of expansions is done.
Furthermore, on a lattice a field theory is \emph{mathematically well-defined}, in contrast with many standard formulations of QFTs (like the path-integral approach).

A lattice formulation of QFTs exposes a close connection with \emph{statistical mechanics} (SM), especially in Euclidean space-time.
In fact, it can be showed that a path-integral in QFT is equivalent to a partition function in SM.
The square of the coupling constant in QFT corresponds directly to the temperature, and a strong coupling expansion becomes equivalent to a high temperature expansion.
Thus, with a lattice formulation of QFTs allows a particle physicist to use the full technology of SM and condensed matter theory.

In this section we first briefly review Yang-Mills theory, which is main formalism for QFTs with gauge symmetries.
Then, we move onto the Wilson formulation of lattice gauge theories in the path-integral approach.
