\section{A case study: \texorpdfstring{$N=2, 3$}{N=2, 3} and \texorpdfstring{$4$}{4}}
\label{sec:a_case_study_N_2_3_4}


In this section we present the results of the numerical investigations of \cite{pradhan2022ladder}.
But first, we present the reasoning for the choice of order parameters used for investigating the phase diagram, and second we show how the duality have been used for resolving the Gauss law in numerics.

\subsection{Numerical results}
\label{sub:numerical_results}

In the following, we present the results with $N=2,3$ and $4$, for different lengths.

\subsubsection*{Results for \texorpdfstring{$N=2$}{N=2}}

As a warm up, we consider the $\Z_2$ ladder \ac{lgt}, with lengths $L=10,12,\dots,18$.
This model is equivalent to a $p=2$ clock model, which is just the quantum Ising chain, with only two super-selection sectors for $n=0$ and $n=1$.
The dual Hamiltonian \eqref{eq:dual_ladder_hamiltonian_real} for $\Z_2$ and sector $n=0$ is
\begin{equation}
    \HamilDual[2]_{n=0}(\lambda^{-1}) = \HamilClock[2](\lambda^{-1}) - 2 \sum_{i} \qty( Z_i + Z_i^{\dagger} ),
\end{equation}
while for $n=1$ we just have
\begin{equation}
    \HamilDual[2]_{n=1}(\lambda^{-1}) = \HamilClock[2](\lambda^{-1}).
\end{equation}

When $n=1$ the Hamiltonian $\HamilDual[2]$ contains only the transverse field, hence it is integrable \cite{baxter1982exactlysm}.
Thus, we expect a critical point for $\lambda \simeq 1$, which will be a DCPT in the gauge model language.
This is clearly seen in the behaviour of the half-ladder \ac{wl}, as shown in the lower panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:z2_wilson}.
For $n=0$, both the transverse and longitudinal fields  are present, hence the model is no longer integrable \cite{banuls2011thermalization, kormos2017confinement, pomponio2022bloch} and we expect to always see a confined phase, except for $\lambda = 0$.
This is indeed confirmed by the behaviour of the half-ladder \ac{wl} shown in the upper panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:z2_wilson}.

Notice that for $n=0$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:z2_wilson}, there is a lack of line crossings between values of \ac{wl} for different $L$.
This suggests that in the thermodynamic limit, we will have a single point $\ev{W} \neq 0$ for $\lambda = 0$, and a flat line $\ev*{W} = 0$ for $\lambda \neq 0$, confirming the prediction of a always confining phase (excluded $\lambda = 0$).

We can further characterize the phases of the two sectors by looking at the structure of the ground state, for $\lambda<1$ and $\lambda>1$, which is possible thanks to the exact diagonalization.
In particular, in the deconfined phase of the sector $n=1$, the ground state is a superposition of the deformations of the non-contractible electric string that makes the $n=1$ vacuum $\ket{\Omega_1}$.
For this reason, this phase can be thought as a \emph{kink condensate} \cite{fradkin1978order} (which is equivalent to a paramagnetic phase), where each kink corresponds to a deformation of the string.
Instead, for $\lambda > 1$, where we have confinement (as in the $n=0$ sector), the ground state is essentially a product state, akin to a ferromagnetic state.
This analysis has been performed at the end of Sec.~\ref{sub:numerical_results}.

    The sector $n=0$ presents only a deconfined point at $\lambda=0$ and then decays rapidly into a confined phase, while the sector $n=1$ has a phase transition for $\lambda \simeq 1$.

\subsubsection*{Results for \texorpdfstring{$N=3$}{N=3}}%


The $\Z_3$ \ac{lgt} is studied for lengths $L=7,9,11$ and $13$.
This model can be mapped to a $3$-clock model, which is equivalent to a $3$-state quantum Potts model with a longitudinal field, which is present in all sectors, as one can see from \eqref{eq:dual_ladder_hamiltonian_real}.
The dual Hamiltonian $\HamilDual[3](\lambda^{-1})$ for the sector $n=0$ is
\begin{equation}
    \HamilDual[3]_{n=0}(\lambda^{-1}) = \HamilClock[3](\lambda^{-1}) - 2 \sum_{i} \qty(Z_i + Z_i^{\dagger}),
\end{equation}
while for $n=1$ and $2$ (which are symmetric to each other) we have
\begin{equation}
    \HamilDual[3]_{n=1,2}(\lambda^{-1}) = \HamilClock[3](\lambda^{-1}) - 2 \cos( \frac{\pi}{3} ) \sum_{i} \qty(\tilde{Z}_i + \tilde{Z}_i^{\dagger}).
    \label{eq:dual_clock_3_1}
\end{equation}
Remember that $\tilde{Z}_i$ stands for the $Z_i$ operator with eigenvalues shifted by $\omega^{1/2} = e^{i \pi /N}$.
In all three cases we have a longitudinal field, which is expected to disrupt any paramagnetic state.
Thus, we do not expect to observe a phase transition, and this is confirmed by the behaviour observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:z3_wilson}.
Meanwhile, all the sectors present a deconfined point at $\lambda = 0$, as expected.

In the case $n=0$, for $\lambda > 0$ we recognize a quick transition to a confined phase, similar to what happens in \cite{burrello2021ladder}.
This behaviour is similar to what has been observed for the $\Z_2$ and $n=0$ case in Fig.~\ref{fig:z2_wilson}, hence the same reasoning apply.
While for $n=1$ and $2$ (which are equivalent), the model exhibits a smoother \emph{crossover} to an ordered phase characterized by a doubly-degenerate ground state, for $\lambda > 1$.
Notice that, as discussed above,  the presence of the ``skew'' longitudinal field breaks the three-fold degeneracy expected in the ordered phase of the $3$-clock model into a two-fold degeneracy only.
Additionally, for $L=13$ we notice that a slight bump start to appear.
If some speculation is allowed, this fact, united with the crossover region, may suggest that is some intermediate phase between the deconfined point and the confined region.
For this kind of analysis, higher lattice sizes are necessary which means that \ac{ed} is no longer adequate.
Thankfully, now that we are confident in the duality between ladder \acp{lgt} and \acp{clock}, we can directly study this region in the \acp{clock} setup, by simulating \eqref{eq:dual_clock_3_1} with for example \ac{dmrg}.

\subsubsection*{Results for \texorpdfstring{$N=4$}{N=4}}%


The $\Z_4$ ladder \ac{lgt} have four super-selection sectors.
The behaviour of half-ladder \ac{wl}s as function of $\lambda$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:z4_wilson}.
The Hamiltonian in the first sector, $n=0$, is
\begin{equation}
    \HamilDual[4]_{n=0}(\lambda^{-1}) = \HamilClock[4](\lambda^{-1}) - 2 \sum_{i} \qty(Z_i + Z_i^{\dagger}),
\end{equation}
As in the previous models, for $n=0$ we see a deconfined point at $\lambda = 0$, followed by a sharp transition to a confined phase.
Likewise, the lack of line crossings of the \ac{wl} at different $L$ suggests that in the limit $L \to \infty$ we will only have $\ev*{W} \neq 0$ for $\lambda = 0$.

The dual Hamiltonian of the sector $n=2$,
\begin{equation}
    \HamilDual[4]_{n=2}(\lambda^{-1}) = \HamilClock[4](\lambda^{-1}),
\end{equation}
has no longitudinal field, it is the only one to present a clear DCPT for $\lambda \approx 1$, as it is expected from the fact that the $4$-clock model is equivalent to two decoupled Ising chains \cite{ortiz2012dualities}.

In the two equivalent sectors $n=1$ and $3$, where the dual Hamiltonian is
\begin{equation}
    \HamilDual[4]_{n=1,3}(\lambda^{-1}) =
    \HamilClock[4](\lambda^{-1}) - 2 \cos( \frac{\pi}{4} ) \sum_{i} \qty(\tilde{Z}_i + \tilde{Z}_i^{\dagger}),
\end{equation}
the longitudinal field is non-zero and the \ac{wl} shows a peculiar behaviour, at least for the largest size ($L=10$) of the chain: it decreases fast as soon $\lambda > 0$, to stabilize to a finite value in the region $0.5 \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 1$, before tending to zero.
It is comparable to $\Z_3$ and $n=1,2$ situation, where a slight bump appear when the size $L$ is increased.
The characteristics of this phase (with the crossover region for $\Z_3$ and $n=1,2$) would deserve a deeper analysis, that we plan to do in a future work.
For $\lambda \gtrsim 1$, the system enters a deconfined phase with a double degenerate ground state, as for the $\Z_3$ model.
