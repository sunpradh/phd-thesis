We wish to investigate the presence of a \emph{deconfined-confined phase transition} (DCPT) for a given $\Z_N$ ladder LGT.
In a pure gauge theory, these phases can be detected
with the perimeter/area law for Wilson loops \cite{wilson1974confinement},
which can be expressed as the products of magnetic operators over a given region.
Unfortunately, in a  ladder geometry there is not much difference between the area and the perimeter of a loop, since they both grow linearly in the size system $L$.

Nonetheless, we expect a phase transition by varying $\lambda$ \cite{trebst2007topological, hamma2008adiabatic, tagliacozzo2011entanglement} that can still be captured by an operator like $W_{\mathcal{R}}= \prod_{i \in \mathcal{R}} U_{i}$, the product of magnetic operators $U$'s over a (connected) region $\mathcal{R}$.
Indeed, when $\lambda=0$, the Hamiltonian \eqref{eq:ladder_hamiltonian} is analogous to a Toric Code \cite{kitaev2003fault} which is known to be in a deconfined phase, where the (topologically distinct) ground states are obtained as uniform superpositions of the gauge-invariant states, i.e.~closed electric loops.
On these ground states $\ev{W_{\mathcal{R}}} = 1$, hence
 a value $\ev{W_{\mathcal{R}}} \approx 1$ signals a deconfined phase.
On the other hand, when $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$, the electric loops are suppressed, hence
$\ev{W_{\mathcal{R}}} \approx 0$, signalling a confined phase.

In the dual clock model picture, the Wilson loop translates to a disorder operator \cite{fradkin1978order}, which means that a deconfined phase can be thought of as a paramagnetic (or disordered) phase, while the confined phase is like a ferromagnetic (or ordered) phase.
Moreover, the longitudinal field breaks the $N$-fold symmetry of the ferromagnetic phase into a one-fold or two-fold degeneracy, depending on the parity ($n$ even/odd) of the superselection sector.

We study the $\Z_N$ LGT on a ladder numerically through \emph{exact diagonalization}, by evaluating the half-ladder Wilson loop, i.e.~
\begin{equation}
    W = U_1 U_2 \cdots U_{L/2},
\end{equation}
and working in the restricted physical Hilbert space $\Hphys^{(n)}$ ($n=0,\dots,N-1$), which has dimension $N^L$, much smaller than $N^{3L}$ (the dimension of the total Hilbert space).

The naive and brute-force method for building $\Hphys$ would require checking the Gauss law at every site (which are $O(3L)$ operations) for all the possible $N^{3L}$ candidate states.
On the other hand, the gauge-reducing duality to clock models provides a faithful and efficient method for building the $N^{L+1}$ basis states of $\Hphys$, yielding a major speedup with respect to the naive method.
%(see \cite{Note1}).
The procedure is quite simple and it consists in treating a clock state as a plaquette flux state in the following way.
Let $\ket{\Omega_0}$ be the vacuum state where all the links are in the $\ket{0}$ state.
For each sector $n$ we can build a ``vacuum'' state $\ket{\Omega_n}$ by applying $\overline{W}$ in \eqref{eq:nonlocal_op_ZN} $n$ times on the true vacuum, i.e.~$\ket{\Omega_n} = \overline{W}^{n} \ket{\Omega_0}$.
Then, let $\ket{s_1 s_2 \cdots}$ be a configuration of the dual $N$-clock model, where $s_i = 0, \dots, N-1$.
Now, the equivalent ladder state in the $n$-th sector can be obtained with $\prod_{i} U_i^{s_i} \ket{\Omega_n}$.

In the following, we present the results with $N=2,3$ and $4$, for different lengths.

\paragraph{Results for \texorpdfstring{$N=2$}{N=2}}
As a warm up, we consider the $\Z_2$ ladder LGT, with lengths $L=10,12,\dots,18$.
This model is equivalent to a $p=2$ clock model, which is just the quantum Ising chain, with only two superselection sectors for $n=0$ and $n=1$.
When $n=1$, the Hamiltonian  contains only the transverse filed and is integrable \cite{baxter1982exactlysm}.
Thus, we expect a critical point for $\lambda \simeq 1$, which will be a DCPT in the gauge model language.
This is clearly seen in the behaviour of the half-ladder Wilson loop, as shown in the lower panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:z2_wilson}.
For $n=0$, both the transverse and longitudinal fields  are present, the model is no longer integrable  \cite{banuls2011thermalization, kormos2017confinement, pomponio2022bloch} and we expect to always see a confined phase, except for $\lambda = 0$.
This is indeed confirmed by the behaviour of the half-ladder Wilson loop shown in the upper panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:z2_wilson}.

We can further characterize the phases of the two sectors by looking at the structure of the ground state, for $\lambda<1$ and $\lambda>1$, which is possible thanks to the exact diagonalization.
In particular, in the deconfined phase of the sector $n=1$, the ground state is a superposition of the deformations of the non-contractible electric string that makes the $n=1$ vacuum $\ket{\Omega_1}$.
For this reason, this phase can be thought as a \emph{kink condensate} \cite{fradkin1978order} (which is equivalent to a paramagnetic phase), where each kink corresponds to a deformation of the string.
Instead, for $\lambda > 1$, where we have confinement (as in the $n=0$ sector), the ground state is essentially a product state, akin to a ferromagnetic state. %(see \cite{Note1})

\paragraph{Results for \texorpdfstring{$N=3$}{N=3}}%
The $\Z_3$ LGT is studied for lengths $L=7,9,11$ and $13$.
This model can be mapped to a $3$-clock model, which is equivalent to a $3$-state quantum Potts model with a longitudinal field, which is present in all sectors, as one can see from \eqref{eq:dual_ladder_hamiltonian_real}.
This field is expected to disrupt any ordered state and thus it is not possible to observe a phase transition, as it is confirmed  by the behaviour of the half-ladder Wilson loops  shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:z3_wilson}.
In addition, all the sectors present a deconfined point at $\lambda = 0$.
In the case $n=0$, for $\lambda > 0$ we recognize a quick transition to a confined phase, similar to what happens in \cite{burrello2021ladder}.
While for $n=1$ and $2$ (which are equivalent), the model exhibits a smoother \emph{crossover} to an ordered phase characterized by a doubly-degenerate ground state, for $\lambda > 1$.
Notice that, as discussed above,  the presence of the ``skew'' longitudinal field breaks the three-fold degeneracy expected in the ordered phase of the $3$-clock model into a two-fold degeneracy only.

\smallskip

\paragraph{Results for \texorpdfstring{$N=4$}{N=4}}%
The $\Z_4$ ladder LGT have four superselection sectors.
The behaviour of half-ladder Wilson loops as function of $\lambda$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:z4_wilson}.
As in the previous models, for $n=0$ we see a deconfined point at $\lambda = 0$, followed by a sharp transition to a confined phase.
The sector $n=2$, which has no longitudinal field, is the only one to present a clear DCPT for $\lambda \approx 1$, as it is expected from the fact that the $4$-clock model is equivalent to two decoupled Ising chains \cite{ortiz2012dualities}.
In the two equivalent sectors $n=1$ and $3$, where the longitudinal field is complex, the Wilson loop shows a peculiar behaviour, at least for the largest size ($L=10$) of the chain: it decreases fast as soon $\lambda > 0$, to stabilize to a finite value in the region $0.5 \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 1$, before tending to zero.
The characteristics of this phase would deserve a deeper analysis, that we plan to do in a future work.
For $\lambda \gtrsim 1$, the system enters a deconfined phase with a double degenerate ground state, as for the $\Z_3$ model.

% \paragraph{Conclusions and outlooks}
% In this work, we proposed an exact gauge preserving duality transformation that maps the  $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory on a ladder onto a 1D $N-$clock model in a transversal field, coupled to a possibly complex longitudinal field which depends on the superselection sector.
%
% This map allowed us to perform numerical simulations with an exact diagonalization algorithm with sizes up to $L=18, 13, 10$ for $N=2,3,4$ respectively.
% To study the phases of the model and a possible DCPT transition, we calculated the Wilson loops in the different topological sectors, finding an unusual behaviour in the sectors with $n$ odd (mod $N$), possibly suggesting the emergence of a new phase, such as for example the incommensurate phase appearing in chiral clock models \cite{huse1983chiral, whitsitt2018clock, zhuang2015clock}, whose characterization requires however to consider longer sizes of the chain in order to evaluate the asymptotic behaviour of correlators.
% This will be the subject of future work, in which we can also consider the possibility to include static and dynamical matter in the lattice gauge model.
