\section{Dualities in physics}%
\label{sec:dualities_in_physics}


Duality is a simple yet powerful idea in physics.
They can be intended as specific mathematical transformations connecting seemingly unrelated physical phenomena.
They have been know for a long time, indeed a first example would be the duality of the electromagnetic field in the absence of sources, noticed by Heaviside in 1884.
Generally in physics, the concept of duality is connected to ideas, like symmetries, mappings between different coupling regimes, perturbative expansions for strongly correlated systems, and the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics \cite{savit1980duality, cobanera2011bond}.

They play a major role in statistical physics and condensed matter.
In statistical mechanics, dualities were introduced for the first time by Kramers and Wannier \cite{kramers1941statistics}, who found a relation between the high temperature and low temperature regimes of the two-dimensional Ising mode.
In this way, they were able to find the critical temperature years before Onsager solution \cite{onsager1944ising}.
In this case we speak of self-dualities, where the same model is mapped onto itself but in a different coupling regime.
The essential legacy of Kramers and Wannier is the fact that self-dualities can put constraints on the phase boundaries and the exact location of critical points.

Not all dualities are self-dualities.
In fact, it also possible to relate two apparently different physical models with a duality transformation.
A known example is the Jordan-Wigner transformation \cite{schultz1964ising, jordan1928pauli}, where spin \ac{dof} (which are bosonic in nature) are mapped onto fermionic \ac{dof} in one-dimension.
This duality shows that, in fact, there is not much difference between bosonic and fermionic \ac{dof} in one dimension.

\subsection{The bond-algebraic approach}
\label{sub:the_bond_algebraic_approach}

In the following section we will quickly review the bond-algebraic approach to dualities \cite{cobanera2010unified, cobanera2011bond}, because it offers a powerful and convenient way for dealing with duality transformations, in particular when gauge symmetries are involved.
The concept of \emph{bond-algebra} was first introduced in \cite{nussinov2009bond} and it exploits the fact that most \emph{Hamiltonian are a sum of simple and (quasi)local terms}:
\begin{equation}
    H = \sum_{\Gamma} \lambda_{\Gamma} h_{\Gamma},
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is a set of indices (e.g.~the lattice sites but can be completely general) and $\lambda_{\Gamma}$ are numbers (usually the couplings).
Roughly speaking, by quasi-local we mean that a operator $h_{\Gamma}$ involves a small number of \ac{dof} that are spatially near each other (for example nearest neighbour).
The terms $h_{\Gamma}$ are called \emph{bond operators} (or simply \emph{bonds}).
From the bonds $h_{\Gamma}$ we obtain a \emph{bond algebra} $\algebra\{h_{\Gamma}\}$, which is the algebra of all the operators generated by all the possible products and sums of the bonds $h_{\Gamma}$ and their Hermitian conjugates.
In practical terms, given a set of bonds $\{h_{\Gamma}\}$, the bond-algebra $\algebra\{h_{\Gamma}\}$ is the algebra spanned by
\begin{equation*}
    \{
        \identity, h_{\Gamma}, \,
        h_{\Gamma}^{\dagger}, \,
        h_{\Gamma} h_{\Gamma^{\prime}}, \,
        h_{\Gamma}^{\dagger}  h_{\Gamma^{\prime}}, \,
        h_{\Gamma} h_{\Gamma^{\prime}}^{\dagger}, \,
        h_{\Gamma}^{\dagger}  h_{\Gamma^{\prime}}^{\dagger}, \,
        h_{\Gamma} h_{\Gamma^{\prime}} h_{\Gamma^{\prime\prime}},
        \dots
    \}
\end{equation*}
By construction, $\algebra\{h_{\Gamma}\}$ is closed under the operation Hermitian conjugation, but since an Hamiltonian $H$ is Hermitian then $h_{\Gamma}^{\dagger} = h_{\Gamma^{\prime}}$ for some $\Gamma^{\prime}$.
Therefore, $\algebra \{h_{\Gamma}\}$ is simply spanned by
\begin{equation*}
    \{
        \identity,
        h_{\Gamma}, \,
        h_{\Gamma} h_{\Gamma^{\prime}}, \,
        h_{\Gamma} h_{\Gamma^{\prime}} h_{\Gamma^{\prime\prime}}, \,
        \dots
    \}
\end{equation*}
Notice that the bonds $h_{\Gamma}$ that generate $\algebra\{ h_{\Gamma} \}$ do not need to be independent.


It is important to point out that a single Hamiltonian $H$ can have different bond algebras associated to it.
In fact, a bond algebra is determined by the partitioning of the bonds in $H$.
In principle, given any two decomposition of the same Hamiltonian,
\begin{equation*}
    H
    = \sum_{\Gamma} \lambda_{\Gamma} h_{\Gamma}
    = \sum_{\Sigma} \lambda^\prime_{\Sigma} h^\prime_{\Sigma},
\end{equation*}
one should expect $\algebra\{h_{\Gamma}\} \neq \algebra\{ h^{\prime}_{\Sigma} \}$ in general (see \cite{cobanera2011bond}).
To make an example, consider the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation*}
    H = \sum_{i} \qty( h_x \sigma^x_i + h_y \sigma^z_i ).
\end{equation*}
We can either partition the bonds by taking $\sigma^x_i$ and $\sigma^z_i$ as generators separately or by taking $h_x \sigma^x_i + h_z \sigma^z_i$ as a single bond.
In the former case we would obtain $\algebra\{\sigma^x, \sigma^z\} $, while in the latter we would have $\algebra\{h_x \sigma^x_i + h_z \sigma^z_i\}$.
These two algebras are clearly different,
\begin{equation*}
    \algebra\{\sigma^x, \sigma^z\}
    \neq
    \algebra\{h_x \sigma^x_i + h_z \sigma^z_i\},
\end{equation*}
because $\algebra\{h_x \sigma^x_i + h_z \sigma^z_i\}$ is commutative, while $\algebra\{\sigma^x, \sigma^z\} $ is not.

In the framework of bond-algebra, quantum dualities can be formulated as \emph{homomorphisms of bonds-algebras}.
By homomorphism we intend a map $\Phi$ between two algebras $\algebra_1$ and $\algebra_2$ that preserves the linear and multiplicative structure of the algebras.
In mathematical terms, given any $u,v \in \algebra_1$ and any complex number $\lambda$ we have
\begin{equation*}
    \Phi(u + \lambda v) = \Phi(u) + \lambda \Phi(v)
    \qand
    \Phi(u v) = \Phi(u) \Phi(v).
\end{equation*}

To be more precise with our definition of quantum duality,
consider two Hamiltonians $H_1$ and $H_2$ that act on Hilbert spaces of the same dimensions.
They are said to be \emph{dual} if there is some bond-algebra $\algebra_{H_1}$ of $H_1$ that is homomorphic to some bond-algebra $\algebra_{H_2}$ of $H_2$ and if the homomorphism $\Phi : \algebra_{H_1} \to \algebra_{H_2}$ maps $H_1$ onto $H_2$, $\Phi(H_1) = H_2$.
These mappings do not need to be isomorphisms (i.e. invertible), especially when gauge symmetries are involved, and we will explain why later.

In a traditional approach to quantum dualities, one tries to map each degree of freedom of $H_1$ onto a degree of freedom of $H_2$.
This can be rather cumbersome, because in this way most duality transformations appear to be non-local.
In other words, one degree of freedom on one side may correspond to a large number of \ac{dof} on the other side.
This is apparent, for example, with the Jordan-Wigner transformation, where a single spin is dual to a whole chain of fermions.

Quantum dualities in the bond-algebraic approach are instead \emph{local}, meaning that each single \emph{bond} $h_{\Gamma_1}$ of $H_1$ is mapped onto a single bond $h_{\Gamma_2}$ of $H_2$.
This may translates in non-locality when treating elementary \ac{dof} and this is due to the fact that the generators of a bond algebra are usually two- (or more) body operators and expressing the elementary \ac{dof} with these operators may require large (if not infinite) products.

An isomorphism like $\Phi$ is physically sound if it is \emph{unitarily implementable} \cite{cobanera2011bond}, which means that there is a unitary matrix $\mathcal{U}$ such that the duality isomorphism reads
\begin{equation}
    \Phi(\mathcal{O}) =
    \mathcal{U} \mathcal{O} \mathcal{U}^{\dagger}, \quad
    \forall \mathcal{O} \in \algebra,
\end{equation}
where $\algebra$ is the operator algebra of the model under investigation \cite{cobanera2011bond}.


To make the bond-algebraic approach more clear we will consider one example: the \emph{\acf{ising}}.
In this model we will see an example of self-duality through the use of disorder variables.
Our intent is not to shine new physics but to show how the use of bond-algebras offers a clear \emph{formalism} for treating dualities.

\subsection{The quantum Ising model}
\label{sub:the_quantum_ising_model}

The \acl{ising} with a transverse field is a chain of spin-\onehalf described by the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
    \HamilIsing(h) = \sum_{i} \qty( \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1} + h \sigma^x_i ),
    \label{eq:hamiltonian_ising}
\end{equation}
where the sums runs over the sites of the chain and $h$ is the transverse field strength.
Notice that the Hamiltonian $\HamilIsing$ is indeed a sum of quasi-local terms.
In particular we have two types of terms: the interaction term $\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}$ and the transverse field $\sigma^x_i$.
They are local or quasi-local because they involve at most two neighbouring sites.
These two sets of terms are the bonds of the Hamiltonian $\HamilIsing$, therefore bond-algebra $\algebra \{\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}, \sigma^x_i\}$ is spanned by:
\begin{equation*}
    \{
        \identity, \,
        \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}, \,
        \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1} \sigma^z_j \sigma^z_{j+1}, \,
        \dots, \,
        \sigma^x_i, \,
        \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j, \,
        \dots, \,
        \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1} \sigma^x_i, \,
        \dots
    \}.
\end{equation*}
We consider an infinite chain in order to avoid subtleties with the boundaries conditions, which can have major effects on a duality transformation.

The algebraic relations that defines the generators of $\algebra^{\ising}$ can be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item each bonds square to the identity operator,
        \begin{equation*}
            (\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1})^2 = (\sigma^x_i)^2 = \identity.
        \end{equation*}

    \item the bonds $\sigma_i^x$ anticommutes with $\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}$ and $\sigma^z_{i-1} \sigma^z_i$ while commuting with the others,
        \begin{equation*}
            \acomm{\sigma_i^x}{\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}} =
            \acomm{\sigma_i^x}{\sigma^z_{i-1} \sigma^z_i} = 0.
        \end{equation*}


    \item the bonds $\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}$ anticommutes with $\sigma^x_i$ and $\sigma^x_{i+1}$ while commuting with the others,
        \begin{equation*}
            \acomm{\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}}{\sigma^x_i} =
            \acomm{\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}}{\sigma^x_{i+1}} = 0.
        \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

Given the symmetric roles that the basic bonds $\sigma^x_i$ and $\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}$ play with each other, we can set up a mapping $\Phi^{\ising}$ that exchange their roles:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi^{\ising}(\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}) = \sigma^x_i, \qquad
    \Phi^{\ising}(\sigma^x_i) = \sigma^z_{i-1} \sigma^z_{i}.
    \label{eq:duality_ising}
\end{equation}
This transformation can be extended to the whole $\algebra^{\ising}$ through the homomorphic property of $\Phi^{\ising}$.
It preserves all the important algebraic relationship and is one-to-one, hence it is an \emph{isomorphism} of $\algebra^{\ising}$ onto itself.
The Hamiltonian $\HamilIsing$ is just an element of $\algebra^{\ising}$.
We can apply $\Phi^{\ising}$ to $\HamilIsing$ and use its homomorphic property, which yields
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \Phi^{\ising}( \HamilIsing(h) )
        & = \sum_{i} \pqty{ \Phi^{\ising} (\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}) + h \Phi^{\ising}(\sigma^x_i)} \\
        & = \sum_{i} \pqty{ \sigma^x_i + h \sigma^z_{i-1} \sigma^z_{i}} \\
        & = h \sum_{i} \pqty{ \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1} + h^{-1} \sigma^x_i}.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Notice that the indices in the sum can be freely shifted because we are working with an infinite number of sites.
We have thus obtained
\begin{equation}
    \Phi^{\ising} (\HamilIsing(h)) = h \HamilIsing(h^{-1}),
\end{equation}
henceforth $\Phi^{\ising}$ is a \emph{self-duality} of \eqref{eq:hamiltonian_ising}.
Notice that $\HamilIsing(h)$ is mapped onto itself but with the inverted coupling, $h \mapsto h^{-1}$, meaning that we can map the strongly coupled phase $h \gg 1$ into the weakly coupled phase $h \ll 1$, and vice versa.
This is basically the quantum version the \emph{Kramers-Wannier duality} \cite{kramers1941statistics, fradkin1978order}.

If we think of the term $\sigma^x_i$ as living on the site $i$ and of $\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}$ as of living on the \emph{link} between the site $i$ and $i+1$, then we can think of $\Phi^{\ising}$ as mapping \eqref{eq:hamiltonian_ising} onto the \emph{dual lattice}.
In fact, the dual lattice of a chain is still a chain and the site term $\sigma^x_i$ is mapped onto a link term $\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}$, and vice versa.


\begin{figure}[t]

    }{
        Pictorial representation of the duality map $\Phi^{\ising}$, that maps the \ac{ising} on the same model on the dual lattice
    }
\end{figure}


We want to have a clearer physical picture of the duality map $\Phi^{\ising}$ and build a bridge with the traditional approach to dualities for the \ac{ising}.
For this reason we want to find the \emph{elementary \ac{dof} of the dual model}.
The \ac{dof} of the dual model lives on the sites of the dual lattice, which corresponds to the links of the original lattice.
On these dual sites we again have spin-\onehalf \ac{dof} and, for more clarity, we use $\mu^x$ and $\mu^z$ for referring to the Pauli matrices acting on these new spins.
The dual site $i$ corresponds to the link $(i, i+1)$, while the dual link $(i-1, i)$  corresponds to the site $i$.

From \eqref{eq:duality_ising}, we already know that
\begin{equation}
    \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1} = \mu^x_i
    \qand
    \sigma^x_i = \mu^z_{i-1} \mu^z_i.
\end{equation}
The role of $\mu^x_i$ is evident, it measure the alignment of two neighbouring spins on the sites $i$ and $i+1$, while the meaning of $\mu^z_i$ is still opaque.
We can arrive at the definition of $\mu^z_i$ by exploiting the map $\Phi^{\ising}$.
The bond $\mu^z_{i-1} \mu^z_i$ corresponds to the image of $\sigma^x_i$ through $\Phi^{\ising}$, so we know how they are mapped.
If we isolate $\mu^z_i$ with an \emph{infinite product}, we then obtain
\begin{equation}
    \mu^z_i
    = \prod_{j = -\infty}^{i} \mu^z_{j-1} \mu^z_j
    = \prod_{j = -\infty}^{i} \sigma^x_j.
    \label{eq:def_mu_z}
\end{equation}
We see that $\mu^z_i$ flips all the spins before the $i$-th site.
From \eqref{eq:def_mu_z}, we can see the \emph{non-local} origin of the dual \ac{dof} in traditional dualities.
When working with two, or more, body terms, in order to isolate a single body term the use of large (or even infinite) product is necessary.

To understand the role of $\mu^x_i$ and $\mu^z_i$, consider now the ferromagnetic ground states $\ket{\Omega_{\rho}}$ of \eqref{eq:hamiltonian_ising}, where $\rho=\uparrow, \downarrow$.
Say we start from $\ket{\Omega_{\uparrow}}$, without loss of generality.
The action of $\mu^z_i$ on $\ket{\Omega_{\rho}}$ is to create a \emph{kink}, which is a domain wall between two ordered regions.
From this point of view, a single spin-flip $\sigma^x_i \ket{\Omega_{\uparrow}}$ creates a \emph{kink-antikink pair}.

\subsection{Gauge-reducing dualities}%
\label{sub:gauge_reducing_dualities}

In this section we will review the notion of \emph{gauge-reducing dualities},
In order to do so we start by highlighting the difference between ordinary symmetries and quantum symmetries.

Following the statement of Wigner's theorem \cite{wigner2012group}, a quantum symmetry is a unitary or anti-unitary mapping that commute with the Hamiltonian.
This does not mean that all symmetries have the same physical meaning or mathematical consequences.
By the term ``\emph{ordinary symmetries}'' we refer to the most common types of symmetry that we encounter in physical systems that usually correspond to \emph{global transformation} of the physical apparatus or system, like for example rotational invariance.
These symmetries have a direct physical impact, since they can influence the level degeneracy of an Hamiltonian and force strict selection rules.

On the other hand, gauge symmetries are \emph{local symmetries} of the model that signal the presence of \emph{redundant \ac{dof}}.
In fact, it is better to think of gauge symmetries as \emph{local constraints} on the elementary \ac{dof} of the gauge model.
As a result, the state space of a gauge model is larger than set of physical states, which are exactly the states that are invariant under the action of the gauge symmetries.
The same reasoning applies to the observables of the gauge model.
An observables is represented by an Hermitian operator and a \emph{physical observable} is represented by an Hermitian operator that commutes with gauge symmetries.

So, if physical states and physical observables already satisfies the local constraints of the gauge symmetries, this means that the physical impact of the latter is already encoded in the former.
It is clear that the ordinary symmetries and gauge symmetries are very different and is better to put them conceptually far apart as possible \cite{cobanera2011bond}.

When dealing with a gauge model, it would be natural to assume that, in order to establish a duality, the gauge symmetries have to be eliminated \emph{first} from the gauge model.
In other terms, that it would be necessary to proceed with gauge-fixing \cite{savit1980duality}.
By gauge-fixing we mean the process of ``turning off'' \emph{some} \ac{dof}, by means of gauge transformations.
A popular example of gauge-fixing in $\Z_2$ or $\Z_N$ \acp{lgt} is the axial gauge, where all the gauge \ac{dof} along a specified direction are fixed \cite{savit1980duality} (i.e.~turned off).
A global gauge-fixing is not always possible and it may depends, for example, on the geometry of system or its boundary conditions.

Although gauge-fixing is common in traditional approach to dualities in gauge models, it is not strictly necessary with bond-algebras.
As stated in \cite{cobanera2011bond}, with the bond-algebraic approach one can find mappings to models without any gauge symmetry, that preserve all the important algebraic properties without the need of gauge-fixing.
Later in the chapters, we will see some examples of gauge-reducing dualities that do not need require gauge-fixing first.

The procedure goes as follows: consider a gauge model and let $H^{\text{G}}$ be its Hamiltonian and $G_{\Gamma}$ its gauge symmetries.
An operator $\mathcal{O}$ is gauge-invariant if and only if it commutes with all the $G_{\Gamma}$:\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{O} \text{~physical}
    \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad
    \comm{\mathcal{O}}{G_{\Gamma}} = 0 \quad \forall \Gamma.
\end{equation*}
Clearly, the Hamiltonian has to be gauge-invariant, hence $[H^{\text{GR}}, G_{\Gamma}] = 0$.
Now let $H^{\text{GR}}$ be the dual Hamiltonian of a non-gauge, or gauge-reduced, model.
Furthermore, let $\algebra^{\text{G}}$ and $\algebra^{\text{GR}}$ be the bond-algebra of the gauge and gauge-reduced models, respectively.
A \emph{gauge-reducing duality} is a map
\begin{equation*}
    \Phi^{\text{GR}} : \algebra^{\text{G}} \to \algebra^{\text{GR}}
\end{equation*}
such that $H^{\text{G}}$ is mapped onto $H^{\text{GR}}$ while making all the gauge symmetries of the gauge model trivial:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi^{\text{GR}}(H^{\text{G}}) = H^{\text{GR}}
    \qand
    \Phi^{\text{GR}}(G_{\Gamma}) = \identity \quad \forall \Gamma.
\end{equation}

Unlike the dualities in Sec.~\ref{sub:the_bond_algebraic_approach}, a gauge-reducing duality like $\Phi_{\text{GR}}$ has to be implementable as a \emph{projective unitary operator} $\mathcal{U}$.
Formally, this can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \Phi^{\text{GR}} ( \mathcal{O} ) = \mathcal{U} \mathcal{O} \mathcal{U}^\dagger, \quad
    \mathcal{U} \mathcal{U}^\dagger = \identity, \quad
    \mathcal{U}^\dagger \mathcal{U} = P_{\text{GI}}
\end{equation}
where $P_{\text{GI}}$ is the projector of the subspace of gauge-invariant states, i.e.~$G_{\Gamma} \ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi}$ for all $\Gamma$.
Roughly speaking, this projective unitary operator can be represented as rectangular matrix that preserves the norm of gauge-invariant states while projecting out all the other states.

In the next section we will use an example of gauge-reducing duality, which will be instrumental for the rest of the chapter.



\subsection{Dualities in two dimensions}
\label{sub:dualities_in_two_dimensions}


As an example of gauge-reducing duality, we will apply the technology introduced in Sec.~\ref{sub:gauge_reducing_dualities} to the $\Z_2$ \ac{lgt} in two-dimensions.
We resume the Hamiltonian \eqref{eq:z2_lgt_hamiltonian}
\begin{equation}
    H^{\Z_2}
    = - \sum_{p} B_p - \lambda \sum_{\link} Z_{\link}
    = - \sum_{p} B_p - \lambda \sum_{x} \qty(Z_{(x, +\hat{1})} + Z_{(x, +\hat{2})}),
    \label{eq:hamiltonian_z2_2d}
\end{equation}
and its Gauss (or vertex) operators
\begin{equation}
    A_v = \prod_{\link \in v}  Z_{\link},
\end{equation}
which generate the gauge symmetries and commute with the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation*}
    \comm{H^{\Z_2}}{A_v} = 0 \quad \forall v \in \Lattice.
\end{equation*}

In particular, each term of the Hamiltonian commutes with the Gauss operators, which means that the bond algebra they generate is gauge-invariant,
This bond-algebra satisfy three simple relations:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item all the bonds square to the identity,
    \item each spin $Z$ anti-commutes with two adjacent plaquettes operators $U$
    \item each plaquette operator $U$ anti-commutes with four spins $Z$.
\end{enumerate}

The model $H^{\Z_2}$ is dual to the $d=2$ \ac{ising}.
The Hamiltonian of the latter in two-dimensions is
\begin{equation}
    \HamilIsing =
    - \sum_{i} \qty(
        \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+\hat{1}} +
        \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+\hat{2}} +
        h \sigma^x_i
    ),
\end{equation}
where the index $i$ runs over the sites.
One recognizes as separate bonds the terms $\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+\hat{1}}$, $\sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+\hat{2}}$, and $\sigma^x_i$.
It is immediate to see that these bonds satisfy the same relations of the bonds of $H^{\Z_2}$.

The dual model of $H^{\Z_2}$ lives on the dual lattice.
Therefore we identify a plaquette $p$ in the gauge model with a site $i$ of the \ac{ising}, while $x$ will refer to the lower left site of the plaquette $p$.
With this notation, we can now build the duality mapping $\Phi^{\text{2d}}$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi^{\text{2d}}(Z_{(x, \hat{1})} )  = \sigma^z_{(i-\hat{2})} \sigma^z_i, \quad
    \Phi^{\text{2d}}(Z_{(x, \hat{2})} )  = \sigma^z_{(i-\hat{1})} \sigma^z_i, \quad
    \Phi^{\text{2d}}(U_p) = \sigma^x_i.
    \label{eq:duality_2d}
\end{equation}
Applying to $\Phi^{\text{2d}}$ to $H^{\Z_2}$ we obtain
\begin{equation*}
    \Phi^{\text{2d}} (H^{\Z_2}) =
    - \sum_{i} \sigma^x_i - \lambda \sum_{i} \qty(
        \sigma^z_{(i-\hat{2})} \sigma^z_i +
        \sigma^z_{(i-\hat{1})} \sigma^z_i
    ) =
    \lambda \HamilIsing(\lambda^{-1})
\end{equation*}
Thus, $\Phi^{\text{2d}}$ maps $H^{\Z_2}$ to $\HamilIsing$, up to a multiplicative constant, if we identify the constants $\lambda \leftrightarrow h^{-1}$.

From \eqref{eq:duality_2d}, one readily obtains
\begin{equation*}
    \Phi^{\text{2d}}(G_x) = \identity,
\end{equation*}
which means that $\Phi^{\text{2d}}$ is in fact a \emph{gauge-reducing duality}.
Therefore, $\HamilIsing$ represents all the physics contained in $H_{\text{gauge}}$, but without all the redundant \ac{dof}.
Notice that we started with the ``raw'' Hamiltonian \eqref{eq:hamiltonian_z2_2d} and obtained $\Phi^{\text{2d}}$ without the need of gauge-fixing.
%In the general case, i.e.~for a generic $\Z_N$ symmetry, the duality leads to an $N$-clock model \cite{radicevic2019spin}.

The reason why it is possible to encode the physical content of the gauge model in a simpler \ac{ising} is the following.
The physical states of a pure gauge model is made of closed electric loops and each electric loop can be thought as containing magnetic flux.
So, each physical state can be fully described by indicating which plaquettes contains magnetic flux and which do not.
The electric lines naturally arises as domain walls between plaquettes with different flux.

Basically, the duality mapping $\Phi^{\text{2d}}$ assigns to each plaquette a spin-\onehalf{} \ac{dof}, indicating the flux state.
Everything else readily follows.
The plaquette operator $U_p$ flips the state of the plaquette, therefore it should be mapped to an operator that flips the spin in $p$, thus $\sigma^x$.
The electric fields $V_{(x, \hat{1})}$ and $V_{(x, \hat{2})}$ are just domain walls between plaquettes, therefore they should be mapped to interaction terms like $\sigma^z_{i-\hat{1}} \sigma^z_{i}$ and $\sigma^z_{i-\hat{2}} \sigma^z_i$.


This duality can be extended to $\Z_N$ models in straightforward manner \cite{radicevic2019spin}.
This requires substituting the Pauli matrices with an equivalent set of operators, that act on a $N$-dimensional local Hilbert space and satisfy an algebra similar to the Schwinger-Weyl algebra \eqref{eq:schwinger_weyl_algebra}.
These operators are the \emph{clock operators} that define the \aclp{clock}.
We will discuss these models in a bit.
