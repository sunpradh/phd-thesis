\subsection{Investigating the phase diagram}%
\label{sub:investigating_the_phase_diagram}

We wish to study the phase diagram of the $\Z_N$ \ac{lgt} phase diagram, in particular we are interested in any \emph{confined} or \emph{deconfined} phase.
In a pure gauge theory, these phases are investigated non-local order parameters like the \emph{\ac{wl}} (not be confused with the non-contractible \ac{wl}s in \eqref{eq:nonlocal_op_ZN}) or \emph{string tension}.
This is because we expect the deconfined phase to be a topological phase, which can be investigated only with non-local order parameters.

Given a closed region $\mathcal{R}$, a \ac{wl} operator $W_{\mathcal{R}}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    W_{\mathcal{R}} = \prod_{\square \in \mathcal{R}} U_{\square}.
    \label{eq:closed_wilson_loop}
\end{equation}
Alternatively, considering the oriented boundary $\partial \mathcal{R}$ one can write
\begin{equation}
    W_{\mathcal{R}} = \prod_{\ell \in \partial \mathcal{R}} U_{\ell},
\end{equation}
where the Hermitian conjugate is implied everytime we move in the negative directions.
It is also implied that the curve $\partial \mathcal{R}$ is a contractible loop.
Wilson showed in \cite{wilson1974confinement} that quark confinement is related to the expectation value $\ev{W_{\mathcal{R}}}$ of a \ac{wl}, which can be thought as a gauge field average on a region.
In particular, in the presence of quark confinement the gauge field average follows an \emph{area law}, where it decays exponentially with the area enclosed by $\mathcal{R}$.
On the other hand, in the deconfined phase we have a \emph{perimeter law}, where the gauge field average decays exponentially with the perimeter of $\mathcal{R}$.

Unfortunately on a ladder geometry there is not much difference between the area and the perimeter of a \ac{wl}.
In fact, in units of the lattice spacing, the area of a \ac{wl} over $n$ plaquettes is $n$ while its perimeter is just $2n+2$.
They both grow linearly.
Nonetheless, we can still look at the behaviour of the \ac{wl}, for a fixed length, at different couplings $\lambda$.

When the coupling $\lambda$ in \eqref{eq:hamiltonian_base} is equal to zero, the \ac{tc} is recovered and in any of its topological sector the ground state is the equal superposition of all the states with any number of closed electrical loops, in a similar fashion to coherent states.
This makes the \ac{tc} a \emph{quantum loop gas}, which is a \emph{deconfined phase}.
Furthermore, the operator $W_{\mathcal{R}}$ in \eqref{eq:closed_wilson_loop} creates an electrical loop around the region $\mathcal{R}$.
From the constraints
% TODO aggiustare ref
% \eqref{eq:constraints_gs_toric_code},
it can easily be proved that $W_{\mathcal{R}}$ leaves the \ac{tc} ground states unchanged, showing in fact that they behaves as coherent states, which leads to $\ev{W_{\mathcal{R}}} = 1$.

Therefore, $\ev{W_{\mathcal{R}}} \approx 1$ signals a deconfined phase and on the other hand a vanishing $\ev{W_{\mathcal{R}}} \approx 0$ corresponds to confined phase.
For this reason, even tough we lack an area/perimeter law on the ladder geometry it is still sensible to look at the behaviour of the \ac{wl}.


Another possible approach for investigating the phase diagram is to use the \emph{string tension}.
In two dimensions, given an \emph{open} curve $\tilde{\mathcal{C}}$ on the dual lattice $\tilde{\mathbb{L}}$ we can construct an open \ac{ths} operator $S_{\tilde{\mathcal{C}}}$ as
\begin{equation}
    S_{\tilde{\mathcal{C}}} = \prod_{\ell \in \tilde{\mathcal{C}}} V_{\ell}
\end{equation}
with the usual caveat: we have to take the Hermitian conjugate everytime the path goes in the negative direction.
Then the string tension is just the expectation value $\ev{S_{\tilde{\mathcal{C}}}}$ it is called in this way because it related to the potential energy (tension) between two magnetic fluxes created at the ends of the curve $\tilde{\mathcal{C}}$.
Henceforth, in a deconfined phase $\ev{S_{\tilde{\mathcal{C}}}} \approx 0$, which means that the magnetic fluxes can be moved freely with no cost in energy, like in the \ac{tc}.
