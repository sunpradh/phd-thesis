\subsection{Duality onto clock models}
\label{sub:duality_onto_clock_models}

In this section we will show how to construct a mapping of the $\Z_N$ ladder LGT onto a $N$-clock model on a chain with a transversal field and a longitudinal field, the latter depending on the topological sector of the ladder LGT.

The first step is the decomposition of the set of bonds in \eqref{eq:hamiltonian_base}.
Obviously, the magnetic terms $U_{\square}$ have to be separated from the electric terms $V_\ell$, but the latter cannot be all treated the same.
It is clear from the geometry of the ladder, that the links $\runglink$ have a different role when compared with the links $\toplink$ and $\botlink$, because the former are \emph{domain walls} while the latter are not.
Therefore, the duality transformation has to distinguish between the vertical links and horizontal links.
Furthermore, also the top links $\toplink$ and bottom links $\botlink$ have to be treated separately because the electric operator on them have different commutation relations with the plaquette operators.
In fact, using the notation introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:abelian_models_on_the_ladder}, we have
\begin{equation}
    U_x \Vdown_x = \omega \Vdown_x U_x, \qquad
    U_x \Vup_x = \omega^{-1} \Vup_x U_x.
    \label{eq:comm_rel_ladder}
\end{equation}
and indeed they acquire different phases.

The plan is to associate to each plaquette a clock degree of freedom, hence we identify a plaquette $\square_x$ with a site $i$ of a clock chain and the magnetic flux of a plaquette becomes the ``fundamental gauge invariant degree of freedom'' of the LGT ladder model.
Given the fact that we are working in the electric basis, we chose for convenience to map the $\Z_N$ magnetic operator $U_x$ to the ``momentum'' operator $X_i$ of the $N$-clock chain.
The electric field on a vertical link $\runglink$ is the result of the flux difference between the two plaquettes that it separates, which suggests that the operator $V_{\runglink}$ have to be mapped to a kinetic-type term like $Z_i^\dagger Z_{i-1}$.
This can be readily verified.
From \eqref{eq:plaq_op_ladder} we get
\begin{equation*}
    V^0_x U_x = \omega^{-1} U_x V_x^0, \qquad
    V^0_x U_{x-1} = \omega U_{x-1} V_x^0,
\end{equation*}
therefore the maps
\begin{equation*}
    U_x \mapsto X_i, \qquad
    V^0_x \mapsto Z_i^\dagger Z_{i-1},
    \label{eq:elec_h_and_plaq_op_map}
\end{equation*}
clearly conserves the commutation relations of $U_x$ and $V^0_x$.

For now we are left with task of finding a suitable mapping of $\Vup$ and $\Vdown$.
With respect to the other bonds of the theory, both of them commute with $V^0$ while for \eqref{eq:comm_rel_ladder} holds for $U_x$.
Hence, a suitable and general mapping of $\Vup$ and $\Vdown$ can be:
\begin{equation}
    \Vdown_x \mapsto \coeffdown_i Z_i, \qquad
    \Vup_x \mapsto \coeffup_i Z_i^\dagger,
    \label{eq:elec_op_horiz_ladder_map}
\end{equation}
where $\coeffdown_i$ and $\coeffup_i$ are complex numbers.
Although, they cannot be any complex number.
Both $\Vdown_x$ and $\Vup_x$ have to be mapped onto unitary operators, which limits the numbers $\coeffdown_i$ and $\coeffup_i$ to be \emph{complex phases}.

To further constraint the value of these coefficients, we can use the Gauss law.
In particular, given the fact that we are looking for a gauge-reducing duality, the aim is to make the Gauss law trivial.
Using the mappings \eqref{eq:elec_h_and_plaq_op_map} and \eqref{eq:elec_op_horiz_ladder_map} in \eqref{eq:gauss_law_ladder} yields
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        G^\uparrow_x & \mapsto
        (\coeffup_i Z_i^\dagger) (\coeffup_{i-1} Z_{i-1}^\dagger) (Z_i^\dagger Z_{i-1})^\dagger
        = \coeffup_i (\coeffup_{i-1})^*, \\
        G^\downarrow_x & \mapsto
        (\coeffdown_i Z_i^\dagger) (Z_i^\dagger Z_{i-1}) (\coeffdown_{i-1} Z_{i-1}^\dagger)
        = \coeffdown_i (\coeffdown_{i-1})^*
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:gauss_law_map_ladder}
\end{equation}

Gauss law have to be satisfied in a pure gauge theory, which mean that we have to impose $G^\uparrow_x = \identity$ and $G^\downarrow_x = \identity$ for all $x$.
This is only possible if
\begin{equation}
    \coeffdown_i = \coeffdown, \qquad
    \coeffup_i = \coeffup, \qquad
    \forall i.
\end{equation}

Furthermore, thanks to \eqref{eq:gauss_law_map_ladder}  we also know how to introduce static matter into this duality, because it can be thought as a violation of the Gauss law.
We just have to change the phases $\coeffup_i$ and $\coeffdown_i$.

The last factor to consider is how the $\coeffup$ and $\coeffdown$ are related on the same site $i$.
In this regard, the topological sectors of the theory come to the rescue.
As established in Sec.~\ref{sec:abelian_models_on_the_ladder}, the topological sectors are identified by the eigenvalue of $S_2$ in \eqref{eq:nonlocal_op_ZN}, which in the ladder geometry becomes
\begin{equation}
    S_2 = \Vup_x \Vdown_x
    \label{eq:top_string_op_ladder}
\end{equation}
for any fixed $x$.
Its eigenvalue are simply $\omega^k$, for $k = 0, \dots, N-1$.

Given a topological sector $\omega^k$, using the mapping \eqref{eq:elec_op_horiz_ladder_map} on \eqref{eq:top_string_op_ladder} yields
\begin{equation}
    S_2 \; \longmapsto \; ( \coeffup Z^\dagger_i ) ( \coeffdown Z_i ) = \coeffup \coeffdown = \omega^k.
\end{equation}
From here, in order to solve for the coefficients $\coeffup$ and $\coeffdown$, one needs only to fix one of the to $1$ and the other to $\omega^k$.
We choose to fix these coefficients as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \coeffup = 1, \qquad
    \coeffdown = \omega^k.
\end{equation}

In conclusion, we summarize the duality mapping for the topological sector $\omega^k$ of the $\Z_N$ LGT on a ladder:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        U_x      & \; \longmapsto \; X_i, \quad &
        V^0_x    & \; \longmapsto \; Z^\dagger_i Z_{i-1}, \\
        \Vup_x   & \; \longmapsto \; Z_i^\dagger, \quad &
        \Vdown_x & \; \longmapsto \; \omega^k Z_i.
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:ladder_duality}
\end{equation}

With the duality \eqref{eq:ladder_duality}, from \eqref{eq:ladder_hamiltonian} in the sector $(\omega^k, 1)$ we obtain
\begin{equation}
    H_{\text{ladder}}(\lambda) \; \longmapsto \; \lambda H_{\text{clock}}(\lambda^{-1})
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    H_{\text{clock}}(\lambda^{-1}) =
    - \sum_{i} Z_i^\dagger Z_{i-1}
    - \lambda^{-1} \sum_{i} X_i
    - (1 + \omega^k) \sum_{i} Z_i
    + \text{h.c.}
    \label{eq:dual_ladder_hamiltonian}
\end{equation}

We see that \eqref{eq:dual_ladder_hamiltonian} is a clock model with both \emph{transversal} and \emph{longitudinal} fields.
In particular, the longitudinal field carries the information of the topological sector of the ladder model.

Interestingly, for $N$ even the sector $k = N/2$ has a special role.
Within this sector $\omega^k = -1$, for which the \emph{longitudinal field disappears} and $H_{\text{clock}}$ reduces to self-dual quantum clock models with a known quantum phase transition.
This phase transitions for $k = N/2$ can be put in correspondence with a \emph{confined-deconfined} transition, which will be discussed in much more detail in the next section.

Let us remark that the complex coupling $(1 + \omega^n)$ does not make the Hamiltonian  (\ref{eq:dual_ladder_hamiltonian}) necessarily chiral \cite{fendley2012parafermions, whitsitt2018clock}.
In fact, one can get the real Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
    H_N = H_p(1/\lambda) - 2 \cos \pqty{\frac{\pi n}{N}} \sum_{i} \pqty{Z_i + Z_i^{\dagger}}.
    \label{eq:dual_ladder_hamiltonian_real}
\end{equation}
by absorbing the complex phase in the $Z_i$-operators, with the transformation $Z_i \mapsto w^{-n/2} Z_i$. This transformation globally rotates the eigenvalues of the $Z_i$-operators, while preserving the algebra relations.
For $n$ even, this is just a permutation of the eigenvalues, meaning that it does not affect the Hamiltonian spectrum. Instead, for $n$ odd, up to a reorder, the eigenvalues are shifted by an angle $\pi/N$, i.e.~half the phase of $\omega$.
The energy contribution of the extra term in \eqref{eq:dual_ladder_hamiltonian_real}  depends on the real part of these eigenvalues and for $n$ odd we obtain that the lowest energy state is no longer unique, in fact it is doubly degenerate.
This means that for $\lambda \to \infty$, where the extra term becomes dominant, we expect an ordered phase with a doubly degenerate ground state.
Finally, one can easily prove that the sectors $n$ and $N-n$ are equivalent
\footnote{For the sector $N-n$ we have that the overall factor $\cos(\pi(N-n)/N)$ is just $-\cos(\pi n/N)$.
The minus sign can then be again absorbed into the $Z$'s operators.
This overall operation is equivalent to the mapping $Z \mapsto \omega^{-n/2} Z$ for the sector $N-n$.}.
