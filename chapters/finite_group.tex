\label{chap:finite_group_gauge_theories}

% In this chapter we present the work \cite{pradhan_unpublished}.
% We first start by reviewing the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian formulation of \acp{lgt}, which works for compact Lie groups.
% Next we will see how to transition from compact Lie groups to finite groups.
% With, we will present the main results of \cite{pradhan_unpublished}, which is the construction of the Hamiltonian and the physical Hilbert space.

In this chapter we present the work \cite{pradhan_unpublished}, where a class of finite-group gauge theories in the Hamiltonian formulation, which mimic some aspects of Lie group Yang-Mills theories on the lattice.
The Hamiltonian is based on the construction of a natural Laplacian operator on the finite group, and is valid for any Abelian or non-Abelian finite group.
As a special case, this includes both the finite-group Hamiltonian obtained via the transfer-matrix formulation from the finite-group Wilson action, but also a wider class of non-Lorentz invariant theories which could be relevant for condensed matter systems.
The characterization of the Hamiltonian using the finite-group Laplacian may be used to obtain non-trivial physical information about the theory.
Irrespective of the choice of Hamiltonian, we show that spin-network states are particularly suitable to give a description of the physical, gauge-invariant Hilbert space for pure gauge theories, and, based on this, we derive a simple formula to compute the dimension of the physical Hilbert space.
Finally, we illustrate the use of the gauge-invariant basis by constructing the Hamiltonian for a gauge theory based on the dihedral group and compute some quantities of interest via exact diagonalization.
