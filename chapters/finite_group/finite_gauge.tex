\section{Ingredients for finite groups}
\label{sec:finite_group_gauge_theory}

In this section we develop an Hamiltonian approach to finite group \ac{lgt}, by showcasing the necessary ingredients.
These main ingredients are basically the Hilbert space and the Hamiltonian operator.
Regarding the Hilbert space, we will show that are two possible choices of basis, that are roughly analogous to a ``position basis'' and ``momentum basis''.
The first would corresponds to the group element basis, while the second to the irreducible representation basis.

As for the Hamiltonian operator, we will focus more on the electric term because the magnetic term is pretty straightforward.
As anticipated, the electric Hamiltonian admits an interpretation as a certain natural Laplacian operator on the group.
This Laplacian is non-unique, which means that for a given gauge group $G$ we can have an entire family of \acp{lgt}.
This construction extends the electric term used in the Kogut-Susskind formulation \cite{kogut1975hamiltonian} of \acp{lgt}, based on Lie groups, to finite groups.
At the end of the section we will also review the question of Lorentz invariance and classification of the possible models.


\subsection{The Hilbert space and gauge invariance}%
\label{sub:the_hilbert_space}

In the Hamiltonian formulation of \acp{lgt} \cite{kogut1975hamiltonian, milstead2018qyangmills, zohar2015latticegauge}, time is continuous while the $d$ spatial dimensions are discretized into a hypercubic lattice $\Lattice$.
The definition of the Hilbert space for both a compact Lie group or a finite group is substantially the same.
As we have seen in Sec.~\ref{sec:wilson_approach_to_lft}, a group element $g \in G$ is assigned to each spatial lattice link $\link \in \Lattice$, where $G$ is the gauge group.
Links are oriented, and if a link is traversed in the opposite orientation, then $g$ is replaced with $g^{-1}$.

In the Lie group case, one would typically write $U_\mu(x) = \exp{(iA_\mu(x))} \in G$ for the gauge field variable assigned to the lattice link $(x, \hat{\mu})$, where $A_\mu(x)$ is the vector potential.
Note that finite groups have no Lie algebras, so we work with group-valued quantities as far as possible.
In what follows, we write $g \in G$ for a group element indifferently for both finite and Lie groups $G$.

\medskip

A classical configuration is given by a choice of group element $g$ on each lattice link,
which means that the configuration space is exactly $G$.
In a quantum theory, the configuration space $G$ has to be upgraded to a Hilbert space $\HilbertG$, spanned by the elements of $G$:
\begin{equation}
    \HilbertSpace^G \equiv \text{span}\{\ket{g} : g \in G\},
    \label{eq:single_link_Hilbert_space}
\end{equation}
Therefore, an element $\ket{\psi}$ of $\HilbertSpace^G$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi} = \int \dd g \; \psi(g) \ket{g},
    \label{eq:superposition_state_Lie_group}
\end{equation}
where $\int \dd g$ is the Haar measure of $G$, if $G$ is a compact Lie group.
In the case of a finite group, \eqref{eq:superposition_state_Lie_group} becomes simply
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi} = \sum_{g \in G} \psi(g) \ket{g},
\end{equation}
where a Haar measure is not needed and a simple sum is sufficient.
The basis $\{\ket{g} : g \in G\}$ can be considered as the analogous of a ``position basis''.
In the case of a Lie group, the wavefunction $\psi(g)$ is square-integrable with respect to the Haar measure.
Therefore, the Hilbert space $\HilbertG$ on each link can be identified with $L^2(G)$, i.e. the space of square-integrable functions on $G$ \cite{milstead2018qyangmills}.
Instead, for a finite group the Hilbert space $\HilbertG$ is simply the \emph{group algebra} $\C[G]$, which is the complex vector space spanned by the group element basis.

The overall Hilbert space $\HilbertTot$ is then given by a tensor product over the links:
\begin{equation}
    \HilbertTot = \bigotimes_{\link \in \Lattice} \HilbertG_{\link},
\end{equation}
where $\HilbertG_{\link}$ is the Hilbert space of the single link $\link$.
Note that for a finite group, $\C[G]$ has finite dimension, because it is spanned by the finitely-many group element states $\{\ket{g}\}$.
Therefore the Hilbert space on each link is finite-dimensional and $\HilbertTot$ is finite-dimensional on a finite lattice, with $\dim \HilbertTot = \abs{G}^L$ where $L$ is the number of links.
For a Lie group, on the other hand, we have infinitely many basis states $\{\ket{g}\}$ and therefore the Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional \textit{on each link}.

\medskip

In the Hamiltonian formulation of gauge theories, the statement that the theory is invariant under gauge transformations translates at the level of the Hilbert space by restricting the allowed states only to those which are gauge-invariant.
In particular, on the single-link Hilbert space one can define left and right ``translation operators'', in the analogy where $\{\ket{g}\}$ is a position basis in group space \cite{zohar2015latticegauge},
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:regular representations}
    L_g \ket{h} = \ket{gh}, \quad \quad R_g \ket{h} = \ket{hg^{-1}}.
\end{equation}
A local gauge transformation is given by a choice of group element $g_x \in G$ at every site $x$ of the lattice \cite{milstead2018qyangmills}.
This acts on the overall Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\text{tot}}$ via the operator
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:gauss law operator}
    \mathcal{G}(\{g_x\}) = \bigotimes_{l=\expval{xy} \in \mathrm{links}} L_{g_{x}} R_{g_y},
\end{equation}
where $\{g_x\}$ is an arbitrary choice of group elements $g_x$ at each lattice site $x$, and the link $l$ connects the points $x$ and $y$.
In other words, each link state $\ket{g_l}$ transforms as $\ket{g_l} \mapsto \ket*{g_x g_l g_y^{-1}}$.

The only physical states are those which satisfy the so-called ``Gauss' law'' constraint \cite{kogut1975hamiltonian, milstead2018qyangmills, tong2018gauge}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lattice gauss law}
    \mathcal{G}(\{g_x\}) \ket{\psi}=\ket{\psi},
\end{equation}
for any possible choice of local assignments $\{g_x\}$ of group variables to lattice sites.
The Gauss law \eqref{eq:lattice gauss law} is an exponentiated version of the usual Gauss law formulated in terms of Lie algebra generators.
The states which satisfy \eqref{eq:lattice gauss law} form the physical, gauge-invariant Hilbert space $\HilbertPhys$.
Note that the condition \eqref{eq:lattice gauss law} only involves group-valued quantities and is thus valid for both Lie groups and finite groups.
In the case of finite groups, the condition simplifies because it is sufficient to impose invariance against a set of generators of the finite group.

One can also straightforwardly include matter fields such as fermion fields which live on each lattice site.
Under a gauge transformation, they transform as $\Psi(x) \to R(g_x) \Psi(x)$, where $R$ is some representation of the gauge group.



\subsection{The representation basis}%
\label{sub:the_representation_basis}

It turns out to be fruitful to introduce a different basis of the overall Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, ``dual'' to the group element basis.
The operators $L_g$ and $R_g$ introduced in \eqref{eq:regular representations} are unitary representations of $G$, known as the \textit{left} and \textit{right regular} representations \cite{serre1967representations, knapp1996lie}.
This is because $L_g L_h = L_{gh}$ and $(L_g)^{-1}=L_{g^{-1}}=(L_g)^\dagger$, as can be explicitly checked by acting on the group element basis, and the same holds for $R$.
Their representation theory leads to the Peter-Weyl theorem \cite{knapp1996lie, milstead2018qyangmills} (see also App.~\ref{sec:peter_weyl_theorem}).
It works for both compact Lie groups and finite groups and it can be summarized as
% , which states that for a finite or compact Lie group $G$,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:peterweyl}
    \HilbertG = \bigoplus_{j \in \Sigma} V_j^* \otimes V_j,
\end{equation}
where $j$ is a label for the \acp{irrep} of $G$, and $\Sigma$ is the set of all \acp{irrep} of $G$.
For more details see App.~\ref{app:some_results_in_representation_theory}, where we collected some general results on representation theory.

Here $V_j$ is the representation vector space corresponding to the representation $j$, and $V_j^{\ast}$ is its dual.
For both compact Lie groups and finite groups the \acp{irrep} are finite-dimensional and can be chosen to be unitary.
For a finite group, $\Sigma$ \emph{is a finite set}, while it is \emph{countably infinite} for a compact Lie group \cite{knapp1996lie, serre1967representations}.
In terms of the Peter-Weyl decomposition, the left and right regular representations take a particularly simple form \cite{marianithesis},
\begin{equation}
    L_g R_h = \bigoplus_j \rho_j(g)^* \otimes \rho_j(h),
    \label{eq:translations peter weyl}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_j$ is the matrix of the $j$-th \ac{irrep} of $G$.
The individual action of either $L_g$ or $R_h$ may be obtained by setting either $g$ or $h$ to the identity.
The formula \eqref{eq:translations peter weyl} is especially useful because, as we will see in Sec.~\ref{sec:physical Hilbert space}, it simplifies the action of the Gauss' law constraint \eqref{eq:lattice gauss law}.

\medskip

The Peter-Weyl theorem provides an alternative basis for the single-link Hilbert space.
For each \ac{irrep} $j$ one chooses appropriate bases for $V_j^{\ast}$ and $V_j$, which we denote $\{\ket{jm}\}$ and $\{\ket{jn}\}$ respectively, where $1 \leq m,n \leq \dim{j}$.
Here $\dim{j} \equiv \dim{V_j}$ is the dimension of the representation.
On each representation subspace, we use the shorthand notation $\ket{jmn} \equiv \ket{jm} \otimes \ket{jn}$.
Then the ``representation basis'' for $\HilbertG$ is given by the set $\{\ket{jmn}\}$ for all $j \in \Sigma$ and $1 \leq m,n \leq \dim{j}$.
In terms of the group element basis, one has \cite{zohar2015latticegauge}
\begin{equation}
    \braket{g}{jmn} = \sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{dim}(j)}{\abs{G}}} \left[\rho_j(g)\right]_{mn},
    \label{eq:change_of_basis}
\end{equation}
where the bases $\{\ket{jm}\}$, $\{\ket{jn}\}$ are chosen so that $\rho_j$ is unitary.
It should be emphasized that \eqref{eq:change_of_basis} is valid for both finite and compact Lie groups; $\abs{G}$ is either the order of the finite group or the volume $\abs{G}\equiv\int dU\, 1$ given by the possibly unnormalized Haar measure \cite{milstead2018qyangmills, marianithesis}.
It is a basic result of the representation theory of finite groups that $\sum_j \pqty{\dim{j}}^2 = \abs{G}$, which ensures that the group element basis and the representation basis have the same number of states \cite{serre1967representations}.

Consider now the case $G = \Z_N$.
It can be written down as
\begin{equation*}
    \Z_N = \{1, r, r^2, \ldots, r^{N-1}\},
\end{equation*}
where $r$ is the generator, while the \acp{irrep} are simply
\begin{equation}
    \rho_j (r^k) = \braket*{r^k}{j} = \omega_N^{kj}
    \qquad \text{for~}  j = 0,1,\dots, N-1
\end{equation}
with $\omega_N= e^{2\pi i /N}$.
Using \eqref{eq:change_of_basis}, the bases $\{\ket*{r^k}\}$ and $\{\ket{j}\}$ are related by
\begin{equation}
    \ket{j}
    = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \ket*{r^k} \! \braket*{r^k}{j}
    = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \ket*{r^k} \omega_N^{kj}.
\end{equation}
We have rediscovered the discrete Fourier transform.
This allows us to think of \eqref{eq:change_of_basis} as a ``non-Abelian Fourier transform'', when the group $G$ is non-Abelian.
In the case of the dihedral group $D_4$ (which will be considered later in this chapter), we have four one-dimensional representations, each of which spans a one-dimensional subspace of $\C[G]$.
Then, have a two-dimensional representation which spans a $2^2=4$ dimensional subspace of $\C[G]$ through the four basis elements $\ket{jmn}$ for $1 \leq m, n \leq 2$.
We have summarized the representation theory of some groups of interest in App.~\ref{sec:some groups of interest}.

\medskip

Since every group admits a trivial, one-dimensional \ac{irrep} with $\rho(g)\equiv 1$, we always have a singlet representation state $\ket{0}$, which may be extended to the whole lattice to form the ``electric vacuum'' $\ket{0_E}$,
\begin{equation}
    \ket{0_E} = \bigotimes_{\link \in \Lattice} \ket{0}_{\link}, \qquad
    \ket{0}_{\link} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\abs{G}}} \sum_g \ket{g}_{\link},
    \label{eq:electric ground state}
\end{equation}
where we used \eqref{eq:change_of_basis} to express $\ket{0}_{\link}$ in the group element basis.

\subsection{The Hamiltonian}%
\label{sub:the_hamiltonian}

A generic \ac{lgt} Hamiltonian $H$ is made of two parts, the electric part $H_E$ and the magnetic part $H_B$, i.e.~$H = H_E + H_B$.
These have to be considered separately and a for a simple reason.
The magnetic term involves only the spatial component of the field strength tensor, i.e., $\mathbf{B}^{2} \sim F^{ij}F_{ij}$, while the electric term involves also the temporal components, i.e., $\mathbf{E}^2 \sim F^{0i} F_{0i}$.
Given that in the Hamiltonian formalism time is continuous while space is discrete, the two terms cannot be treated on the same footing.
This differs from the Wilson action approach, where the magnetic and electric are treated equally because it has to be Lorentz-invariant.

The Hamiltonian for a \ac{lgt} takes the general form \cite{kogut1975hamiltonian, zohar2015latticegauge}
\begin{equation}
    H = \lambda_E \sum_{\link \in \Lattice} h_E + \lambda_B \sum_{\square} h_B(g_\square),
    \label{eq:generic_hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
where $h_E$ is an operator that depends only on each lattice link, while $h_B$ depends on the lattice plaquettes $\square$.
The symbol $g_{\plaquette}$ stands for the product of the link variables around a plaquette $\plaquette$, i.e. $g_\plaquette = g_1 g_2 g_3^{-1} g_4^{-1}$.
It is also possible to add matter fields, but we focus here on the pure gauge theory.

If the gauge group is a Lie group, each group element $g = e^{iX}$ can be written as the exponential of a Lie algebra element $X$.
Then one also has infinitesimal generators of left-translations $\hat{\ell}^a_L$ such that
\begin{equation*}
    L_{e^{iT^a}} = \exp{\pqty{i \hat{\ell}_L^a}},
\end{equation*}
where $T^a$ is a Lie algebra basis and $a$ a color index \cite{milstead2018qyangmills}.
In other words, $\hat{\ell}_L$ is the Lie algebra representation corresponding to the group representation $L$, and plays the role of the chromo-electric field.

The Lie group Hamiltonian, also known as the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, is then given by \cite{kogut1975hamiltonian, milstead2018qyangmills}
\begin{equation}
    h_E = \sum_{a} \pqty{\hat{\ell}^a_L}^2
    \qand
    h_B = 2(\dim{\rho} - \Re \tr{\rho(g_\square)}),
    \label{eq:kogut_susskind_hE_hB}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the fundamental representation of $\SU(N)$, with couplings $\lambda_E = g^2/2$ and $\lambda_B = 1/g^2$ in terms of a coupling constant $g$ (the lattice spacing is set to $1$).
As the group element basis may be thought of as a ``position basis'' in group space, the infinitesimal generators of translations $\hat{\ell}_L^a$ may be thought of as ``momentum'' operators in group space.
Then the electric Hamiltonian $h_E$, which is the sum of the squares of the ``momenta'' in all directions, is a \emph{Laplacian in group space}.
Applying the Peter-Weyl decomposition \eqref{eq:translations peter weyl} to $\hat{\ell}_L^a$, one finds that \cite{milstead2018qyangmills,marianithesis}
\begin{equation}
    h_E =
    \sum_{a} \pqty{\hat{\ell}^a_L}^2 =
    \sum_{jmn} C(j) \ket{jmn}\bra{jmn},
    \label{eq:laplacian_decomposition}
\end{equation}
where $C(j)$ is the quadratic Casimir operator, which depends only on the representation $C(j)$.
For $\U(1)$, for example $C(j)=j^2$, while for $\SU(2)$ one finds $C(j) = j(j+1)$.

\medskip

We note that the magnetic Hamiltonian depends only on group-valued quantities and is therefore well-defined for both Lie groups and finite groups.
On the other hand, the electric Hamiltonian depends on the infinitesimal Lie algebra through $\hat{\ell}_L^a$ and therefore \emph{the definition does not extend to finite groups}.
Nonetheless, the decomposition \eqref{eq:laplacian_decomposition} is well-defined also for finite groups, but one must leave the coefficients $C(j)$ unsatisfactorily unspecified because finite groups do not have a Casimir operator \cite{zohar2015latticegauge}.

If one thinks of a finite group as a natural discretization of some parent Lie group, the natural choice of electric Hamiltonian is a discrete Laplacian on the finite group.
The geometric structure of a finite group is that of a graph, with group elements as vertices and the group operation defining the edges.
This is called a \textit{Cayley graph}.
The discrete Laplacian on the finite group is then naturally given by the graph Laplacian of the Cayley graph.
This choice also preserves the interpretation of the electric Hamiltonian as a quantum-mechanical rotor in group space \cite{kogut1975hamiltonian}.

We explain the construction of the finite group Laplacian in detail in Sec.~\ref{sub:the_finite_group_laplacian}, and the resulting Hamiltonian takes the form of \eqref{eq:generic_hamiltonian} with
\begin{equation}
    h_E = \sum_{g \in \Gamma} (1-L_g)
    \qand
    h_B= h_B (g_\square),
    \label{eq:generalized ym hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma \subset G$ is a subset of the group (\emph{not} a subgroup) such that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $1 \not \in \Gamma$, i.e.
        $\Gamma$ doesn't contain the identity element.
    \item $\Gamma^{-1}=\Gamma$, i.e.
        it is invariant under inversion of group elements.
        In other words, if $g \in \Gamma$, then $g^{-1} \in \Gamma$ also.
    \item $g \Gamma g^{-1} = \Gamma$, i.e.
        it is invariant under conjugation.
        In other words, $\Gamma$ is a union of conjugacy classes of $G$.
\end{enumerate}
These conditions on $\Gamma$ ensure that the electric Hamiltonian is gauge-invariant.
On the other hand, as usual, the magnetic term is gauge-invariant as long as $h_B$ is any real function such that $h_B(g_1 g_\square g_1^{-1})=h_B(g_\square)$ for any $g_1 \in G$.
As explained in Sec.~\ref{sub:action_formulation}, the Hamiltonian \eqref{eq:generalized ym hamiltonian} includes as a special case the transfer-matrix Hamiltonian obtained in \cite{harlow2018quantum} which consists in a certain specific choice of subset $\Gamma$.
The choice of $\Gamma$ is in fact not unique, a fact which we will also discuss in later sections.

\medskip

While the magnetic Hamiltonian $h_B$ is diagonal in the group element basis, the electric Hamiltonian $h_E$ is diagonal in the representation basis.
In fact, $h_E$ in \eqref{eq:generalized ym hamiltonian} in the \ac{irrep} basis becomes
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:electric hamiltonian rep basis}
    h_E = \sum_{jmn} h_E(j) \ket{jmn}\bra{jmn}
    \quad \text{with} \quad
    h_E(j)=\abs{\Gamma} - \frac{1}{\dim{j}} \sum_{g \in \Gamma} \chi_j(g),
\end{equation}
where $\abs{\Gamma}$ is the number of elements in $\Gamma$ and $\chi_j$ is the character of the \ac{irrep} labelled $j$.
The electric Hamiltonian may be interpreted as an ``on-link'' hopping term within group space; in fact, up to a constant, it may be written as
\begin{equation}
    h_E = -\sum_{g \in \Gamma} \sum_{h \in G} \ket{gh}\bra{h},
\end{equation}
 and it favours each link to sit in the electric ground state \eqref{eq:electric ground state}, which is fully delocalized in group space.
On the other hand, the magnetic term is a plaquette-based potential which pushes plaquettes close to the identity.
The competition between the two non-commuting terms gives rise to non-trivial dynamics.

\medskip

We would like to emphasize that the description of the electric Hamiltonian $h_E$ in \eqref{eq:generalized ym hamiltonian} as the graph Laplacian of the Cayley graph associated with the group is not simply an interesting analogy, but also a tool which may be used to extract information on the Hamiltonian itself.

As an example, we note the well-known fact that the smallest eigenvalue of a graph Laplacian is always zero (given by the trivial representation state \eqref{eq:electric ground state}) and its degeneracy equals the number of connected components of the graph \cite{spectralgraphtheory}.
Moreover, it is not hard to show that if $\Gamma$ does not generate the group $G$, but rather only a subgroup $\expval{\Gamma} < G$, then the Cayley graph splits into connected components which are identified with the cosets of $\expval{\Gamma}$ in $G$.
The number of such components, and therefore the degeneracy of the ground state of $h_E$ on each link, is given by
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{electric\,ground\,state\,degeneracy}=\frac{\abs{G}}{\abs{\expval{\Gamma}}}.
\end{equation}
This is the degeneracy of $h_E$ on each link; the degeneracy of the electric Hamiltonian $H_E = \sum_{\mathrm{links}} h_E$ on the Hilbert space of the whole lattice is larger.
If, instead, $\Gamma$ generates the whole group, then the electric Hamiltonian is not degenerate.
A detailed proof can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:laplacian degeneracy}.
The degeneracy of the electric ground state is not only an important feature of the theory, but also technically important for methods such as adiabatic quantum simulation.

As we will see at the end of Sec.~\ref{sub:the_finite_group_laplacian}, an electric Hamiltonian with degenerate ground state can be constructed in the simple case of the dihedral group $D_4$.
% In general, the electric ground state degeneracy can also occur with the choice of $\Gamma$ arising from the transfer-matrix formulation of the Wilson action, as described in Sec.~\ref{sub:action_formulation}.
% For example, consider the permutation group $G=S_5$.
% Starting from the Wilson action in the six-dimensional faithful \ac{irrep} of $S_5$, one finds $h_E$ with $\Gamma$ equal to the conjugacy class of the $5$-cycles; then $\Gamma$ generates the subgroup $\expval{\Gamma} = A_5$ and since $\abs{S_5}/\abs{A_5}=2$, the electric Hamiltonian ground state is two-fold degenerate, with the ground states spanned by the two representation states corresponding to the one-dimensional \acp{irrep}.

    \label{fig:examples of Cayley graphs}
\end{figure}

In this section we explain in detail the construction of the finite group Laplacian, which we take as the electric Hamiltonian, as the graph Laplacian of the Cayley graph of the finite group.
Given a finite group $G$, we choose a set of generators $\Gamma \subset G$, which we require to be invariant under inversion and conjugation.
In other words, $\Gamma^{-1}= \Gamma$ and $g \Gamma g^{-1} = \Gamma$ for any $g\in G$ \cite{spectralgraphtheory}.
% , that is $\Gamma^{-1}=\Gamma$, and moreover that it is the union of conjugacy classes, so that it is invariant under conjugation, $g \Gamma g^{-1}=\Gamma$ for any $g$ in $G$ \cite{spectralgraphtheory}.
We choose $\Gamma$ not to include the identity element and we note that the choice of $\Gamma$ is not unique.

The Cayley graph has the group elements as vertices, and we place an edge between $g \in G$ and $h \in G$ if $h g^{-1} \in \Gamma$.
The result is a simple undirected graph.
Examples of Cayley graphs for the groups $\Z_5$ and $D_4$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:examples of Cayley graphs}.
Given any graph, its Laplacian is defined as \cite{spectralgraphtheory}
\begin{equation}
    \Delta = D-A,
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $D$ is the degree matrix.
Each of these matrices acts on the vector space of graph vertices, which in the case of a Cayley graph can be identified with the group algebra $\C[G]$.
The degree matrix is always diagonal, and in this case $D=\abs{\Gamma} \mathbbm{1}$.
The adjacency matrix $A$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    A_{gh} = \begin{cases}1 & g h^{-1} \in \Gamma\\ 0 & \mathrm{otherwise}\end{cases}
\end{equation}
for group elements $g,h$.
On a basis element, one has
\begin{equation}
    A \ket{g} \equiv \sum_h A_{hg} \ket{h} = \sum_{k \in \Gamma} \ket{gk} = \sum_{k \in \Gamma} \ket{gk^{-1}} = \sum_{k \in \Gamma} R_k \ket{g},
\end{equation}
where $R_k$ is the right regular representation, and we used the closure of $\Gamma$ under inversion.
Therefore as an operator on $\C[G]$,
\begin{equation}
    A = \sum_{k \in \Gamma} R_k = \bigoplus_j \mathbbm{1}_j \otimes \pqty{\sum_{k \in \Gamma} \rho_j(k)},
\end{equation}
where we used the Peter-Weyl decomposition of $R_k$ \eqref{eq:translations peter weyl}.
Then we see that
\begin{equation}
    \pqty{\sum_{k \in \Gamma} \rho_j(k)} \rho_j(g) = \sum_{k \in \Gamma} \rho_j(kg) = \sum_{k \in \Gamma} \rho_j(g k g^{-1} g) = \rho_j(g) \pqty{\sum_{k \in \Gamma} \rho_j(k)},
\end{equation}
where we used the closure of $\Gamma$ under conjugation.

Hence the operator $\pqty{\sum_{k \in \Gamma} \rho_j(k)}$ commutes with the irreducible representation $\rho_j$ and as such is proportional to the identity by Schur's lemma \cite{serre1967representations}.
The constant of proportionality can be readily computed by taking a trace.
This therefore implies
\begin{equation}
    A = \sum_j \lambda_j P_j, \quad \quad \lambda_j = \frac{1}{\dim{j}} \sum_{k \in \Gamma} \chi_j(k).
\end{equation}
where $P_j = \sum_{mn} \ket{jmn}\bra{jmn}$ is the projector onto the $j$-th representation subspace, and $\chi_j$ is the character of the \ac{irrep} labelled $j$.
Therefore the Laplacian of the Cayley graph is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:laplacian finite group}
    \Delta = \sum_j f(j) P_j, \quad \quad f(j)= \abs{\Gamma}-\frac{1}{\mathrm{dim}(j)} \sum_{k \in \Gamma} \chi_j(k).
\end{equation}
which is the same form as the electric Hamiltonian in the representation basis, \eqref{eq:electric hamiltonian rep basis}.
For any finite group, this formula defines the electric energy $f(j)$ to be assigned to each \ac{irrep}.

\medskip

We give some examples of this construction.
For the group $\Z_N$ it is natural to construct the electric eigenvalues $f(j)$ with the generating set $\Gamma = \{r, r^{-1}\}$ where $r$ is a generator of $\Z_N$, which results in
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fj ZN}
    f(j)=f(N-j) = 4\sin^2\pqty{\frac{\pi j}{N}},
\end{equation}
which is the same as in \cite{notarnicola2015discrete}.
Moreover for large $N$,
\begin{equation}
    f(j) \to \frac{4\pi^2}{N^2} j^2 \qquad N \mathrm{~large},
\end{equation}
which is proportional to the Casimir eigenvalues of $\U(1)$ gauge theory \cite{notarnicola2015discrete}.
Thus both a truncation of $\U(1)$ theory and proper $\Z_N$ theory naively approach $\U(1)$ theory for large $N$, albeit in different ways.
One can however choose a different generating set, such as $\Gamma = \{r, r^{-1}, r^2, r^{-2}\}$ and the corresponding eigenvalues would be
\begin{equation}
    f(j)=f(N-j) = 4\sin^2\pqty{\frac{\pi j}{N}}+4\sin^2\pqty{\frac{2\pi j}{N}}.
\end{equation}
For the dihedral group $D_4$ we can choose for example
\begin{equation*}
    \Gamma_1 = \{r,r^3,s,r^2s\},
\end{equation*}
which gives rise to the eigenvalues $f(j)$  shown in Table \ref{tab:fval}, where the representations are ordered like in the character table in Table \ref{tab:chars_D4} in Appendix \ref{app:the_dihedral_groups}.
Note that $\Gamma_1$ generates the whole group.

    \label{tab:fval}
\end{table}

By looking at its character table, we may in fact classify all possible choices of $\Gamma$ for $D_4$.
In fact, $D_4$ has five conjugacy classes:
\begin{equation*}
    C_0 = \{e\}, \quad
    C_1 = \{r, r^3\}, \quad
    C_2 = \{r^2\}, \quad
    C_3 = \{s, r^2s\}, \quad
    C_4 = \{rs, r^3s\}.
\end{equation*}
One can check that, as is generally true, $\sum_i \abs{C_i}=8=\abs{G}$.
In this case, all conjugacy classes are invariant under inversion, i.e.
$C_i^{-1}=C_i$.
 Hence any union of the $C_i$'s ($i \neq 0$) is a valid choice for $\Gamma$.
There are $2^4$ such possibilities.
Note that this is not true in general, in which case one must choose conjugacy classes to ensure that $\Gamma^{-1}=\Gamma$.
In the next sections we will consider in more detail two specific cases:
\begin{equation*}
        \Gamma_2 = C_1 \cup C_3 \cup C_4=\{r, r^3, s, rs, r^2s, r^3s\}
        \quad \text{and} \quad
        \Gamma_3 = C_1 \cup C_2 = \{r, r^2, r^3\}.
\end{equation*}
The choice of $\Gamma_2$ is especially interesting, because it corresponds to the Hamiltonian arising from the transfer-matrix procedure when $h_B$ is the real part of the trace of the faithful \ac{irrep} of $D_4$; therefore, this choice gives rise to a manifestly Lorentz-invariant theory.
Note that also $\Gamma_2$ generates the whole group.
On the other hand, the set $\Gamma_3 = \{r, r^2, r^3\}$ does not generate the whole group, but only the subgroup of rotations;
this is reflected in the electric eigenvalues in Table \ref{tab:fval}, with the electric ground state being two-fold degenerate on each link.




\subsection{Action formulation and Lorentz invariance}%
\label{sub:action_formulation}


The Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian \eqref{eq:kogut_susskind_hE_hB} may be obtained via the transfer-matrix formulation from the Euclidean Wilson action \cite{creutz1977transfermatrix,kogut1979introduction}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:wilson action}
    S = -\frac{2}{g^2} \sum_{\square} \Re \tr{\rho(g_\square)},
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the coupling.
In the path-integral formulation, the lattice is fully discretized and thus plaquettes extend also in the time direction.
The action \eqref{eq:wilson action} is also perfectly valid for finite groups, as one simply replaces the integration measure over the Lie group with a sum over the elements of a finite group.
The representation $\rho$ can be chosen to be any faithful representation of the finite group (not necessarily irreducible).
One may then repeat the transfer-matrix formulation for an arbitrary finite group \cite{harlow2018quantum}.
Starting from the action \eqref{eq:wilson action}, the transfer-matrix procedure gives rise to a Hamiltonian of the form \eqref{eq:generalized ym hamiltonian} that we've described, with
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lorentz invariance relations}
    \Gamma = \{g \in G,\; g \neq 1, \; \mathrm{max} \bqty{\Re \tr{\rho(g)}} \}
    \qand
    h_B=-2\Re\tr\rho.
\end{equation}
In other words, the magnetic Hamiltonian is directly inherited from the action, while the electric Hamiltonian takes the form of the finite-group Laplacian with a specific choice of $\Gamma$.
In the example of the gauge group $D_4$, if we choose the faithful, two-dimensional \ac{irrep} for $h_B$, then $\Re\tr\rho(g)$ can equal $2, 0, -2$ on the different conjugacy classes (see the character table of $D_4$ in Table \ref{tab:chars_D4}).
Since $\Re\tr\rho(1)=2$, then $\Gamma$ consists of all group elements $g$ such that $\Re\tr\rho(g)=0$.
This gives rise to the generating set $\Gamma_2$ anticipated in Sec.~\ref{sub:the_finite_group_laplacian}.

These considerations are especially important for the Lorentz invariance of the theory.
While the lattice discretization breaks the Lorentz symmetry to the subgroup of Euclidean cubic rotations, as long as this subgroup is preserved one expects to recover Lorentz invariance in the continuum limit.
In particular, the action \eqref{eq:wilson action} is manifestly invariant under Euclidean cubic rotations and, therefore, one expects that it gives rise to a  Hamiltonian which describes a Lorentz-invariant theory in the continuum.
Intuitively, a Lorentz transformation can swap the electric and magnetic fields, and it is therefore not surprising that in a Lorentz-invariant theory the electric and magnetic Hamiltonians must satisfy specific relations with each other.

In particular, finite-group Hamiltonians of the form \eqref{eq:generalized ym hamiltonian} which however do not respect the relations \eqref{eq:lorentz invariance relations} cannot arise from an action of the form \eqref{eq:wilson action}.
For example, they could come from an action in which plaquettes extending in one direction (the ``time'' direction) are weighted differently.
For such Hamiltonians, it is unclear whether they describe a Lorentz-invariant theory.
This includes in particular setting $h_E(j)=j^2$ for subgroups of $\U(1)$ and $h_E(j)=j(j+1)$ for subgroups of $\SU(2)$ in \eqref{eq:electric hamiltonian rep basis}, while keeping $h_B$ unchanged.
In all such cases, the remnant Lorentz symmetry is explicitly broken.
While Lorentz symmetry is required in particle physics applications, it might not be necessarily required in other cases, such as some condensed matter applications, and one may thus independently choose $\Gamma$ and $h_B$.



\subsection{Classification of the possible theories}
\label{sub:classification_of_theories}

The construction of finite group \acp{lgt} with Hamiltonian \eqref{eq:generalized ym hamiltonian} involves a few arbitrary choices which can be classified.
Since the Hilbert space is fixed to the physical, gauge-invariant Hilbert space $\HilbertPhys$, the only possible choices involve the various terms in the Hamiltonian.
Given a gauge group $G$ in $d$ spatial dimensions, one may arbitrarily choose:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A set $\Gamma$ of group elements which does not contain the identity, and is invariant under both inversion and conjugation $\Gamma^{-1}=\Gamma$ and $g \Gamma g^{-1}$.
    \item A choice for the magnetic Hamiltonian $h_B = h_B(g_\square)$.
Since it must be real and satisfy $h_B(g_1 g_\square g_1^{-1})= h_B(g_\square)$, i.e.
it is a \textit{class function}, by a well-known result \cite{serre1967representations} it may be expanded in a sum of characters of irreducible representations, $h_B(g) = \sum_j c_j \chi_j(g)$ for coefficients $c_j$ which may be chosen arbitrarily, while ensuring that $h_B(g)$ is real.
Most typically $h_B = -2 \Re\tr\rho$, where $\rho$ is some representation (not necessarily an \ac{irrep}).
    \item If present, possible choices of representations and Hamiltonians in the matter sector.

    \item One can also add a Chern-Simons term as in \cite{caspar2016doubledlattice}.
This is especially interesting for quantum simulation, because such theories have a sign problem.
\end{enumerate}
Further considerations involve the Lorentz symmetry, as explained in Sec.~\ref{sub:action_formulation}.
Moreover, one may want to choose representations which are non-trivial when restricted to the center of the gauge group \cite{holland2001center, cohen2014center}.

We note that the above construction allows further generalizations.
In particular, the discretized $d$-dimensional space does not have to take the form of a hypercubic lattice, but more generally can be a Bravais or non-Bravais lattice, or even a cell complex.
No difference arises for the electric term, which is link-based, and the plaquette variable in the magnetic term is replaced by an an elementary closed loop in the lattice.
