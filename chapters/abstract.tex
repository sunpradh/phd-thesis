\begin{abstract}
    The present manuscript focuses on Lattice Gauge Theories based on finite groups.
    For the purpose of Quantum Simulation, the Hamiltonian approach is considered, while the finite group serves as a discretization scheme for the degrees of freedom of the gauge fields.
    Several aspects of these models are studied.
    First, we investigate dualities in Abelian models with a restricted geometry, using a systematic approach.
    This leads to a rich phase diagram dependent on the super-selection sectors.
    Second, we construct a family of lattice Hamiltonians for gauge theories with a finite group, either Abelian or non-Abelian.
    We show that is possible to express the electric term as a natural graph Laplacian, and that the physical Hilbert space can be explicitly built using spin network states.
    In both cases we perform numerical simulations in order to establish the correctness of the results and further investigate the models.
