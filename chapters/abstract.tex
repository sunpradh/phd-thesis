\begin{abstract}
    The present manuscript focuses on Lattice Gauge Theories based on finite groups.
    For the purpose of Quantum Simulation, the Hamiltonian approach is considered, while the finite gauge group serves as a discretization scheme for the degrees of freedom of the gauge fields.
    Several aspects of these models have been studied.
    First, we investigated dualities in Abelian models with a restricted geometry, using a systematic approach.
    This lead to a rich phase diagram dependent on the super-selection sectors.
    Second, we construct a family of lattice Hamiltonians for gauge theories with a finite group, either Abelian or non-Abelian.
    We show that is possible to express the electric term as a natural graph Laplacian, and that the physical Hilbert space can be explicitly built using spin network states.
